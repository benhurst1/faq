Payments are paid into your stripe account, before then being transferred to your bank account.</p><p>For hourly care, clients are charged on the following Sunday after the visit. This means a weekly total payment will be in your stripe account on the Sunday before it is processed and transferred. Up to 10 business days, the payment will be transferred to your bank account.</p><p>Your clients' payment method will determine how long payments may take to reach your personal account.</p><p>Cash from clients paying via card, will hit your personal bank account up to 7 days after the Sunday on which it is charged.</p><p>Cash from clients paying via direct debit, will hit your personal bank account up to 10 days after the Sunday on which it is charged.</p><p>Cash from clients paying via invoice, will hit your personal bank account on the Monday after which they have paid.</p><h2>How do payments work for live-in care?</h2><p>Live-in clients are charged in the same two ways:</p><p>Clients pay for the previous 7 days on the Sunday, where it is paid into your STRIPE account. In which the money is transferred to your personal bank account up to 7 or 10 days after, based on the client's payment method. (As explained above).</p><p>Invoiced clients are invoiced on a Friday and you will be paid directly into your bank account on a Monday.</p><h2>How does the insurance work?</h2><p>All visits booked over the platform with qualified carers are covered by our insurance.

First of all you may already have a notification on your dashboard asking you to leave your carer some feedback.</p><p>Or you can go to one of your visits. From the visit details you will see your carer's profile picture, under that image, you will see a big blue button that says \"leave carer feedback\".</p><p>And the easiest way, is to simply click on the carer feedback tab in your dashboard. From there you can choose one of the carers you have contacted and leave them a review for others to see.</p><h2>Why leave feedback</h2><p>This feedback is not for you. This is for the carer that has been helping you. By leaving a review, not only do you show your appreciation towards your carer, but you also give them a better chance at finding more work in the future.</p>",
